# svm01xht

**Language:** R

**Description:**
An R package for binary support vector machine (SVM) classification with hypothesis testing utilities. It covers a basic binary SVM workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, parameter tuning, prediction, and evaluation. Functions for simple hypothesis tests, such as Z-test and likelihood ratio test (LRT), are included to assess the model's accuracy to a specified baseline. Additionally, visualization functions are provided to help users inspect the data and illustrate Type I error behavior from the hypothesis tests. For details on how to use the package, please refer to `svm01xht/inst/doc/SVM-and-Hypothesis-Testing.html`.

**How to run:**
- Download `svm01xht_0.1.1.tar.gz`.
- In an R codespace, run `install.packages("path/to/svm01xht_0.1.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")` in the console.
- Run `library(svm01xht)` to load the functions in the package to your R environment.
