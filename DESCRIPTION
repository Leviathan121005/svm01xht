Description: An R package for binary support vector machine (SVM) classification with hypothesis testing utilities. 
  It covers a basic binary SVM workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, parameter tuning, prediction, and evaluation. 
  Functions for simple hypothesis tests, such as Z-test and likelihood ratio test (LRT), are included to assess the model's accuracy 
  to a specified baseline. Additionally, visualization functions are provided to help users inspect the data and illustrate hypothesis 
  test results.
